I'm Haoan (Lori) Li, a software engineer currently pursuing a Master of Science in Software Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University's Silicon Valley campus. I am proficient in C/C++, Rust, Python, Java, and other languages with experience in system engineering, backend development, and deep learning. I have industry experiences through my internships where I have created software testing frameworks, contributed to video playback engine, and trained human re-ID models. I am eager to innovate and contribute my problem solving abilities to the software industry.

### What has been the most technically challenging thing youâ€™ve worked on?*
The most technically challenging thing that I've worked on is when I collaborated with a group of chip designers to create a kernel that runs on top of the chip that is currently in prototyping phase.  Because the chip that runs on fpga has a lot of unresolved hardware bugs, and I was using a relatively new language called Rust, the development of the kernel was challenging. With persistence and a lot of research, I was able to nail out all the issues and have a working kernel up and running.

### What do you spend time on outside of school and internships?*
Outside of school and internships, I like to learn about latest technology in the software world and play with server hardwares. I have linux installed in my desktop and I learned rust. I have multiple servers/SBC running around the world so that I could use VPN to travel to any of the locations. I even bought 40G networking hardware to establish a highspeed local connection between my desktop and my server.
