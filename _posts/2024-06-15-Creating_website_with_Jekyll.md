title: "Creating website with Jekyll"

I have always wanted to make a blog to record the projects that I've done in the past. Having a blog not only helps people who are working on similar projects, but also work as a reference for myself as I have poor memories. 

A few months ago I attempted to use React/Nextjs to create a website. However, web design is really *not* my strength and the development was too demanding. I don't want to be learning the entire full stack to just write a few articles. I needed something that's simpler and allow me to focus on just writting the contents. Jekyll is what I found this time.

The backbone of this website is my [Github repo](https://github.com/Lorilandly/skills-github-pages), and it is a fork of this [Github course](https://github.com/skills/github-pages). The course is a tutorial that teaches you how to set up github pages and build a simple website with Jekyll in a few steps. Each time a step is completed, the course uses github actions to update the repo to show the next step. The end result is a simple page that is hosted on Github!

Jekyll is really simple to use. To change the index page, one just edit `index.md`. To add an article, one just add a markdown file in the `_posts/` folder. Once the changes are pushed onto the repo, my website will be updated in just a few minutes!

I love hosting my blog this way for:

- It's free
- It's simple
- No maintenance needed
